# SnowMan Hangman

SnowMan is a modern twist on the classic **Hangman** game, built with **C#** and **Avalonia UI**.  
Instead of drawing a gallows, each wrong guess slowly builds a snowman until the game ends!

---

## Features
- Interactive **GUI** built with Avalonia.
- Word guessing with support for letters, `'` (apostrophe), and `-` (hyphen).
- Visual snowman drawing that grows with each wrong guess.
- Displays guessed letters to avoid repeats.
- Keyboard support (Enter key submits guesses).
- "New Game" button to restart anytime.
- Input automatically disabled once the game ends.
